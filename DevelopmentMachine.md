Hardware made from some old gaming parts and newer parts for a development workstation.

Will be used for virtualization and docker including gpu workloads. As most forums are tailored towards gaming and parts are expensive, I decided to take a gamble on some parts. I will be upgrading over time if the need arises. Passthrough is also a goal but will be skipped for the moment due to gpu prices and the need for various workarounds depending on use case.
